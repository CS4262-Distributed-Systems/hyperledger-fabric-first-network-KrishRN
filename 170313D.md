**Assignment for CS4262-Distributed Systems**

Concepts learned about Blockchain

1. **SMART CONTRACTS** - They are digital contracts where a user can set up some pre-determined 
rules where when those rules get executed all the participants in the contract get their share of payment/ assets.
As you can see whole process is automated. Once the user completes with the specified rule of the contract, the 
smart contract will release the payment automatically.

2. **Consensus among the Nodes** - These are algorithms used to help the nodes in the Blockchain network to acheive an
agreeement over some validation processes in a set of transactions. There are a whole of different Algorithms to achieve this
a famous Blockchain user Bitcoin uses Proof-of-work Algorithm to achieve Consensus.
